## Advent of Code 2024

OK. It's time for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/). From my quick look at the 2023 puzzles I can't see me getting through all 24.
But let's give it a go! I'm still keen to get a taste of different languages and frameworks in the process.
I'll be looking for succinct code over performant cod and not worrying too much about error handling unless relevant to the puzzle.

### Calendar

1. ["Historian Hysteria"](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) - I'm going to look at doing this in .NET. I use .NET day-to-day, but on Windows. I'm setting this up on Linux and using VS Code as my IDE to see what that experience is like.
