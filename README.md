## Advent of Code 2024

OK. It's time for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/). From my quick look at the 2023 puzzles I can't see me getting through all 24.
But let's give it a go! I'm still keen to get a taste of different languages and frameworks in the process.
I'll be looking for succinct code over performant code and not worrying too much about error handling unless relevant to the puzzle.

### Calendar

1. ["Historian Hysteria"](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) - I completed this in .NET (C#). I use .NET in my job, but on Windows. I set this up on Linux and used VS Code as my IDE to see what that experience was like. Quite honestly it wasn't bad. Would take some getting used to the VS Code tooling. But the cut-down experience might even be preferable. Would be interested to see how well it worked for a larger solution though.
2. ["Red-Nosed Reports"](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) - I've been wanting to try one of these in rust. So let's give it a go!
